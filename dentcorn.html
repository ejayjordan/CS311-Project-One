        <h1>Dent Corn</h1>
        <p>The majority of corn grown in the U.S. is dent corn, also called field corn. It is mainly used for livestock
            feed. It is called dent corn because it has a dent in the kernel. This type of corn is not eaten fresh and
            is harvested when the kernels are dry.</p>
