    <h1>History of Corn</h1>

    <p>The history of modern day corn begins about 10,000 years ago. Ancient farmers took the first steps in growing corn when
    they chose which kernels to plant. Corn comes from a wild grass plant called teosinte, which is still growing in Mexico
    today. Native Americans brought corn up the Mississippi River. The earliest corn plant was very small, but after periods
    of breeding by Native Americans, pilgrims, and scientists, the corn plant has changed into the corn we know today.
    Native Americans found out that corn grew well in Iowa’s soil and could be worked easily with with bone hoes and wooden
    digging sticks. Modern Iowa farmers produce a bushel of corn with only six minutes of man-labor. Native Americans spent
    about twenty hours of man-labor on each bushel.</p>

    <p>In the Pioneer days, women spent most of their time growing, preserving, and preparing food. Corn could be prepared in
    many different ways, such as Johnny cakes, hominy, corn bread, and cornmeal mush. Hand-picking corn was still the
    hardest job on the farm. It started in October and it might take the whole family several cold months to finish.</p>

    <h1>Corn Today</h1>
    <p>Corn has been the leading crop in Iowa for more than 150 years. Iowa produces more corn than the entire
    country of Mexico. On average, Iowa grows 183 bushels of corn per acre. Nationally the average is 173 bushels per acre
    (USDA). Tractors are becoming more technologically advanced and planting and harvesting corn is becoming easier over
    time.</p>
    
    <h2>Hybrid Corn:</h2>
    <p>Scientists discovered that allowing the pollen from one corn plant to pollinate itself created an inbred plant with
    special characteristics. This plant was called a hybrid, which had some unique traits, such as a higher yield or
    resistance to insect pests. Even though hybrid corn cost more to produce, farmers liked the improved yield, and hybrid
    corn became popular across the Corn Belt. In 1933, less than 1% of all corn raised in Iowa was hybrid corn. Just nine
    years later, in 1942, virtually 100% of all corn raised in Iowa was hybrid corn.</p>
    
    <h2>Why is hybrid corn better?</h2>
    <p>Three acres of hybrid corn produces the same amount of corn as four acres of old-fashioned corn, so farmers could grow
    more corn on their land. Hybrid corn stands up well, so it is easier to harvest with a machine. The old-fashioned corn
    had stalks and roots that were weak, and they “blew down,” so it was hard for machine pickers to harvest the corn.</p>
