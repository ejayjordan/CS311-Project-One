    <h1>History of Corn</h1>
    <p>The history of modern day corn begins about 10,000 years ago. Ancient farmers took the first steps in growing corn when
    they chose which kernels to plant. Corn comes from a wild grass plant called teosinte, which is still growing in Mexico
    today. Native Americans brought corn up the Mississippi River. The earliest corn plant was very small, but after periods
    of breeding by Native Americans, pilgrims, and scientists, the corn plant has changed into the corn we know today.
    Native Americans found out that corn grew well in Iowaâ€™s soil and could be worked easily with with bone hoes and wooden
    digging sticks. Modern Iowa farmers produce a bushel of corn with only six minutes of man-labor. Native Americans spent
    about twenty hours of man-labor on each bushel.</p>

    <p>In the Pioneer days, women spent most of their time growing, preserving, and preparing food. Corn could be prepared in
    many different ways, such as Johnny cakes, hominy, corn bread, and cornmeal mush. Hand-picking corn was still the
    hardest job on the farm. It started in October and it might take the whole family several cold months to finish.</p>
